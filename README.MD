The Parelli vs. ISES Principles dataset
by Steve North, Ann Hemingway, Andrew McLean, Harriet Laurie and Caroline Ellis-Hill. 2016.

This dataset represents observation frequency scores (4 observers) for behaviours in 'An ethogram for Equitation Science First Principles of Horse Training.pdf' (see the'IPTEK ISES Principles Training Evaluation Kit' for methodological detail).

The video materials of Parelli Natural Horsemanship are compared with the ISES (International Society for Equitation Science) First Principles of Horse Training.

Conforming = ethogram behaviours ending in .1

Conflicting = ethogram behaviours ending in .2

The Parelli Educational Materials (‘The Four Savvys DVD Pack’ 2015) consists of 25 discs and an estimated total duration of 100 hours video.

Selected video clips represented in the dataset:

video batch 1 = 


Online - Level 4 - Principle Games - 0:29.18

Online - Level 4 - Purpose Games - 0:49:46

Liberty - Get Ready - Games 1-5 - 0:33:36
